# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis (No Seaborn Version)

This project explores and analyzes a student performance dataset using core Python libraries: **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** (no Seaborn used).

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
- File used: `student-mat.csv` (Math course data)

## 📊 Data Analysis Performed

1. **Average Final Grade (G3)**
2. **Count of Students Scoring Above 15**
3. **Correlation between Study Time and Final Grade (G3)**
4. **Gender-wise Average Grades**

## 📈 Visualizations

All visualizations were created using `matplotlib`:
- 📌 **Histogram** of final grades (G3)
- 📌 **Scatter Plot** between Study Time and Final Grade
- 📌 **Bar Chart** of Average G3 by Gender

Screenshots of the visualizations are included in this repository.
